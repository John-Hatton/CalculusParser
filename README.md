# Calculus Parser

---


## Introduction

This project is ambitious one, with hopes to parse equations such as "2+2" and "x+x"

We're not quite there yet, but major improvements have been made.

## Embedded Calculus

See Embedded Calculus, which is a sister project. This project is aimed at being for 
desktop computers, but many of the concepts and classes will be the same.


Also see the test cases, to see how the project is coming together. 

As of posting, the project compiles, but not all test cases are passing. Lot's of work to do.
